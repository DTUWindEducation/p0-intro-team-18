1. What is the difference between git and GitLab?
Git is a distributed version control system that can be installed on a computer, allowing developers to track changes in their code collaboratively. In contrast, GitLab is an online hosting service that provides a platform for hosting Git repositories, which can be accessed securely over the internet.

2. What is the difference between GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket?
They are all version control platforms for managing code. GitHub is primarily focused on open-source collaboration and is known for its large community, GitLab provides a more comprehensive suite for software development and deployment, while BitBucket is more focused on private repositories with deep integration into Atlassian tools.

3. Why would I ever want to use git, but not GitLab?
Using Git can be particularly beneficial for individual use due to its flexibility, simplicity, and control over version control processes. This way, one can manage their code locally, work offline, and customize workflows without being tied to a specific platform like GitLab.

4. What are the steps to update the GitLab server with some changes I made on my computer?
Firstly, stage the changes to be included in the next commit by using git add <file>. Then, commit the staged changes to the local repository with git commit -m "message". Finally, push the changes to the server using git push.
